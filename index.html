                        <p class="white">Mettacracy is a web 3.0 protocol, a DApp accessible from any device connected to the Internet and allows you to easily expose your ideas to global communities as well as to communities that you can create yourself. If your idea or proposal is supported by the majority, Mettacracy rewards your initiative by transferring IMA tokens to your wallet and a team of thousands of communicators spread the result of your proposal around the world.</p>
                        <p class="white">With Mettacracy any community can come together and act in consensus to achieve their goals, now we can transmit our discontent and demand answers without the risk of having to make public street demonstrations, without injuries, without material losses and preserving the lives of our comrades.
                        <p class="white">Through Mettacracy we can organize, unite, cooperate and act as a unit to respond to institutions, organizations and opinion matrixes that pretend to ignore our authority.</p>

                <h2>How does Mettacracy work?</h2>
                <p class="mt-3"><strong><em>If you have an idea to propose, if you disagree with the prevailing system, if your representatives are not fighting for your interests, if you don't trust politicians and want to take action to build a fair system for all, your place is in Mettacracy, become a member, add your intelligence and your will to thousands of people just like you.</em></strong></p>
                <p class="mt-3">Political actions begin as a complaint, a nonconformity, a certainty that there are better ways to achieve goals. Mettacracy's objective is to allow any person to initiate a political action by presenting clear proposals to the corresponding community and among all to develop that proposal to adopt it as a solution.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">Mettacracy does not demand solutions from any institution, organization or level of government, Mettacracy is the organized society presenting the best solutions and alternatives for all.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the protocol works.</p>

                        <p class="gray">Mettacracy is designed to make it very easy to present proposed solutions to your complaints or conflict situations.</p>
                        <p class="gray">You fill out a form and your proposal is presented to the community(ies) of your choice.</p>

                        <p class="gray">A good proposal will attract many members who will support you and work with you to analyze, discuss and develop your proposal.</p>

                        <p class="gray">If the proposal is approved, it becomes a majority resolution and is sent to the communications team.</p>

The resolution is also made public through digital media, blogs, social networks, messaging app groups, newsletters and mailing lists.</p>
